# Test Case Generator - https://obinnaas.github.io/TestCaseGenerator/
## 1.0 INTRODUCTION
This documentation provides an overview of the Test Generator User Interface that generates test cases for validating the data type and values of columns in a specified table for a BI testing team. The UI prompts the user to enter the table name and column names separated by tabs, then generates a test case for each column and writes it to a CSV file. 

## 2.0 VERSION CONTROL
The code is version controlled using Git and is stored in a repository on GitHub. This allows for easy collaboration and tracking of changes to the code.

## 3.0 BUSINESS AND PROJECT BENEFITS
The use of this User Interface can provide several benefits to businesses and projects. By automating the generation of test cases, it can save time and reduce the risk of human error. This can help to ensure that the data in the specified table is accurate and reliable, which can improve decision-making and reduce the risk of costly mistakes.
In addition, the use of this UI can help to improve the efficiency of testing processes. By generating test cases automatically, testers can focus on executing tests and identifying issues rather than spending time manually creating test cases. This can help to speed up testing cycles and improve the overall quality of the BI reports being tested.

## 4.0 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, Test Case generator provides an easy way to generate test cases for validating the data type and values of columns in a specified table. By automating this process, businesses and projects can save time, reduce errors, improve efficiency, and make better decisions based on accurate data. By following best practices such as using version control and writing clear and concise code, this script can be easily maintained and updated as needed.
